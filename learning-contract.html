            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>
                I hope to develop a thorough understanding during this learning process.
                Honing useful abilities that I can use in real-life scenarios. I hope to get constructive criticism from
                my
                Instructor and fellow students who will assist me to identify my weaknesses and strengths. I expect a
                supportive learning environment.
                Encouraging and challenging enough to help me to step outside from my current abilities. Additionally,
                having access to tools, resources, and advice that will benefit me would mean a lot for my expected OJT
                or on-the-job training.
                I expect this subject, stated to be the mastery related to my chosen track would benefit me greatly for
                the actual working environment.

            <h2>Motivations</h2>
            <p>
                My main motivations for this course are mostly enthusiasm for both career and personal development.
                Firstly, I am motivated by the desire to widen my knowledge, improve my skill set as a web developer,
                and keep up with industry developments, best practices, and new technologies. Also, to be honest, my
                main motivation for this course is to just pass, get my allowance, and get things done smoothly. It does
                not mean I entirely hate or avoid web development; I find all things from it, such as libraries and
                frameworks, to be exciting, and I play around with creative packages. If I could say so, I should find
                at least a passion to encourage motivation in web development, which is creating my own systems that
                actually solve problems—even if it is repetitive or made before by millions of students. I just like
                doing weird projects.

        <!-- Contributions Section -->
        <section id="contributions">
            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                In contributions, I can commit by actively participating in this class, inquiring of the professor, and
                collaborating with my classmates. Also, I would commit to doing advanced reading and programming of the
                tech stacks to be used in this course. I will pass my assignments on time with quality and honest work.
                I might use AI for reference in building structures, but I would do as little usage of AI as possible. I
                should respect my professor's time in giving out his effort to teach the course. Finally, I should
                contribute through continuous coding of Laravel, React, and utilizing Xampp

        <!-- Hindrances Section -->
        <section id="hindrances">
            <h2>Hindrances</h2>
            <p>
                In hindrances, I have a lot of challenges internally, such as procrastinating, being a slow learner
                compared to other peers, possibly taking this as a lower priority than other academic work, and lastly,
                having a lot of things to compromise over my other courses, including this. Possibly, I can improve all
                of these hindrances, but Capstone 2 is such a hassle. Also, using and installing Xampp in Linux, or in
                my case, is problematic. All of these hindrances do not entirely make me any less capable of achieving
                good marks since I still want high grades.
